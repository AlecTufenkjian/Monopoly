Cegep Project - A Simple Monopoly Game

This project is a recreation of the monopoly game in Java. The most interesting concept i learned while developing is Java serialization. Essentially it allows me to save the game progress by writing progress classes in binary files, and then reading them back when progress is loaded. Please [click here](Showcase.txt) to quickly see what the game looks like!
